# SFG_localfieldfactors
Calculation of local field correction factors for SFG spectroscopy.

This simple program allows local field correction factors (sometimes called "Fresnel Factors" - somewhat erroneously) to be plotted for the most common achiral tensor elements probed in SFG spectroscopy. Experimental parameters can be easily changed and the effect on the factors can be seen. The equations plotted were taken from the paper by Zhuang et al - https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.59.12632. One may question whether this needs to be its own repository given that "plotting an equation" is not very difficult - but we needed to find an easy way to link/cite this in a paper...
